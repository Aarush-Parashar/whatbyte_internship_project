Here is a professional and comprehensive `README.md` file for your GitHub repository. It includes sections for features, setup instructions (crucial since you are gitignoring `firebase_options.dart`), and screenshots.

You can copy and paste this directly into a file named `README.md` in your project root.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Framework:** Flutter (Dart)
* **State Management:** Flutter Riverpod 2.x
* **Backend:** Firebase (Auth, Cloud Firestore)
* **Architecture:** Feature-first / Repository Pattern

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
* [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) (for configuring the project)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vibrant-todo.git
cd vibrant-todo

```


2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
flutter pub get

```


3. **Configure Firebase:**
*Since `firebase_options.dart` is not included in the repo for security, you must generate your own.*
1. Create a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Enable **Authentication** (Email/Password provider).
3. Enable **Cloud Firestore** (Create database in test mode or set up rules).
4. Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
flutterfire configure

```


5. Select your project and the platforms (iOS, Android, Web) you want to support. This will generate the `lib/firebase_options.dart` file.


4. **Run the app:**
```bash
flutter run

```



## 📂 Folder Structure

The project follows a clean separation of concerns:

```
lib/
├── models/             # Data models (Task)
├── providers/          # Riverpod state providers & Repository logic
├── screens/            # UI Screens (Auth, Home, Add/Edit)
├── widgets/            # Reusable UI components (TaskTile, etc.)
├── firebase_options.dart # Generated by FlutterFire
└── main.dart           # Entry point & Theme configuration

```

## 🔒 Firestore Security Rules

To ensure data privacy, add these rules to your Firestore console:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      // Only allow users to read/write their OWN data
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}

```
